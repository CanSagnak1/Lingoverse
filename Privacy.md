        Last Updated: January 1, 2026

        Lingoverse ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

        1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

        We collect minimal information to provide you with the best experience:

        • Search History: Your recent word searches are stored locally on your device to provide quick access to previously searched words.

        • Favorites: Words you save as favorites are stored locally on your device.

        • Cache Data: Previously searched word definitions are cached locally to enable offline access and faster loading.

        2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

        The information stored on your device is used solely to:
        • Display your recent search history
        • Maintain your favorites list
        • Provide offline access to cached word definitions
        • Improve app performance

        3. DATA STORAGE

        All data is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and NSCache). We do not transmit your personal data to external servers.

        4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

        Our app uses the Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev) to fetch word definitions. When you search for a word, your search query is sent to this third-party service. Please refer to their privacy policy for information about how they handle data.

        5. DATA RETENTION

        • Recent Searches: Up to 15 recent searches are retained
        • Favorites: Retained until you manually remove them
        • Cache: Automatically expires after 7 days

        6. YOUR RIGHTS

        You can:
        • Clear your search history at any time
        • Remove words from favorites
        • Clear the cache from Settings
        • Delete the app to remove all stored data

        7. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

        Our app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not require any personal information to function.

        8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.
